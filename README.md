# Competitive-Programming-Library
A collections of algorithms & data structures for competitive programming, compiled
from textbooks, online tutorials, and libraries modified for the goals of being

-Dependency free (no copying & pasting allowed in the ACM-ICPC)
-Short, Readable, Fast
-Understood well by myself since many algorithmic challenges require these
data structures to be adapted or augmented to solve the problem (e.g. changing merge sort to count 
inversions of an array rather than sort)
